* **AWS Budgets**: Allows the students define a budget. It sends a notification to all the subscribers when the cost of the other services exceed the 100% of the defined amount of money. This resource reset's the first day of ever√Ω month.

* **Amazon SNS**: Amazon Simple Notification Service creates a Topic and publish there, every resources subscribed to that Topic will receive a notification when the SNS get triggered.

* **Lamda Function and State Machine**: Lambda in charge of executing the process in the state machine (Step Functions). Step functionas are Lambda functions orchestration that starts the process of stopping EC2, RDS and Sage Maker instaces.

* **SNS and Email Notification**: SNS creates a Topic and all the resources subscribed can get a notification, in this the email given as a parameter to the template will receive a notification about results of the process.

* **AWS CloudWatch**: Lambda in charge of cleaning the resources sends logs to cloudwatch. This logs will be sent to the user as a cloudwatch link to see in detail the results of the process.

* Cleaning_Lambda: Lambda function that lists Instances and tries to stop them. It also checks the state of the instaces.

* Notify_Lambda: Lambda function in charge of sending the notification about the process to the specified email address.

* Process-Notification: SNS Topic that publishes a message to the specified email address.
